            <h1>Antoine Henri Becquerel. Born in France,Pairs December 15, 1852. 
                Becquerel was the first person to ever get evidence of radioactivity. 
                Becquerel was a really smart man, he was a french engineer phnd ysicist aa noble laurete. 
                When Henri Becquerel investigated the newly discovered X-rays in 1896, 
                it led to studies of how uranium salts are affected by light. 
                By accident, he discovered that mit a puranium salts spontaneously entrating radiation that can be registered on a 
                photographic plate. Further studies made it clear that this radiation was something new and not X-ray radiation: 
                he had discovered a new phenomenon, radioactivity.</h1>
