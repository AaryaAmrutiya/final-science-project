    <h1>Ernest Rutherford was the central figure in the study of radioactivity, and with his concept of the nuclear atom he led the exploration of nuclear physics. He won the noble prize for Chemistry in 1908. Rutherford got a invintation to collaborate on a investigation of the way in which X-rays changed the conductivity of gases. This went to a classic paper on ionization, the breaking of atoms or molecules into positive and negative parts.</h1>
